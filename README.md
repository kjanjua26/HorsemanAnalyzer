# HorsemanAnalyzer
A mac-based song analyzer application built to classify and play songs based on your mood.

## Version 1.0
The first version contains the option to classify and play songs based on mood (currently there are three moods to choose from: happy, sad, romantic).
The goal is to learn a classifer to classify songs into one of the three moods and then play a song that is a closest match (in terms of signal distance). I am using Dynamic Time Wraping (DTW) to compute the signal distance.
